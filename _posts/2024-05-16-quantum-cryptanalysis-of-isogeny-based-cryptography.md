## Abstract

Isogeny-based cryptography is  one of the newest branches of post-quantum cryptography. The main appeal of isogenies is that you can design a variety 
of schemes from them and they all require relatively small bandwidth. The talk will focus on quantum cryptanalysis of isogeny-based schemes. This will involve 
applications of hidden shift, hidden subgroup algorithms and connections to pathfinding in graphs. I will demonstrate the recent break of pSIDH and improved 
quantum algorithms for finding fixed degree isogenies and pose an array of open problems which do not require isogeny expertise.
