## Abstract

Based on the article of Arjan Cornelissen, Yassine Hamoudi and Sofiene Jerbi, we will look into the problem of estimating in Euclidean norm the mean of a vector-valued random variable with finite mean and covariance. Unlike classically, where any univariate estimator can be turned into a multivariate estimator with at most a logarithmic overhead in the dimension, no similar result can be proved in the quantum setting. Previously S. Heinrich ruled out the existence of a quantum advantage for the mean estimation problem when the sample complexity is smaller than the dimension. [https://doi.org/10.1006/jcom.2001.0629] The main result of the authors is to show that, outside this low-precision regime, there is a quantum estimator that outperforms any classical estimator. Their approach is substantially more involved than in the univariate setting, where most quantum estimators rely only on phase estimation, exploiting a variety of additional algorithmic techniques such as amplitude amplification, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, and quantum singular value transformation.
